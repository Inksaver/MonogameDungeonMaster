# DMClone-00-Engine

This is a modified version of the Monogame Engine from the book Monogame Mastery by Jarred Capellman and Louis Salin ISBN 978-1-4842-6308-2 The original version can be found at https://github.com/Apress/monogame-mastery/tree/main/chapter-11/end/Engine.

I do not like the _variable underscore convention widely used in Monogame, and some features have been deleted, others modified to suit the development of a clone of the FTL game Dungeon Master https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_(video_game)

There is no output from this project except the standard blank Cornflower Blue window expected from the default Monogame OpenGL application. It is the base from which all tutorial videos on Youtube will be produced in the near future.
